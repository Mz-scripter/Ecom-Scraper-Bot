# Ecom-Scraper-Bot
A Python-based scraper bot designed to extract product titles and prices from ecommerce sites for data analysis and monitoring.
## eBay Web Scraper
For this project, I utilized Selenium for web automation, selecting "Flash Costume" as the test case. This query had a limited number of pages on eBay, approximately 240 results, which provided better control during the scraping process. Despite the relatively small dataset, the script required 71.7456 seconds to fully execute and save the results to a CSV file. 
The codebase includes two versions: `main_draft.py` with comprehensive inline comments for clarity and `main.py`, a streamlined version without comments for production use.
## Bookscraper
I'm thrilled to share that I just completed my first web scraping project using Scrapy. The performance has been outstandingâ€”it only took 29 seconds to scrape 1,000 results, which is significantly faster than what I experienced with Selenium. Given these results, I'm seriously considering transitioning to Scrapy for my future scraping tasks.
